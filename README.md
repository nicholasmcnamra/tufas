# tufas

An app for climbers who want to be able to keep a log of all of the climbs they have done, whether it be at a local crag or a spot on the other side of the country. Tufas will allow users to tick off climbs(version 1), share beta(climbing moves), leave notes on the area (version 2), upload photos(version 3), and videos of their climb (version 4). 

Since many climbing areas are in isolated parts of state and national parks and forests (off trail), there are no climbing apps that can give a user a direct path to a crag if it’s off trail. A long term goal for this app will be to track the user’s journey to a crag to be able to create navigation paths to hard-to-find locations (version -i will get here at some point-).

I found https://openbeta.io/, an open-source api that connects to a GraphQL database of climbs across the country that I will utilize to get crag info (areas, descriptions, latitude and longitude points).
